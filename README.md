# Arraymaker

Work in progress...so it doens't work yet.

when it's done the program will be used to created large arrays of random numbers that are randomly sorted for the purpose of using them to learn about timing with sorting and searching algorithms.

It is meant to be used alongside the Unix time command.

### installation
```
$ make install
```

### Usage
```
$ arraymaker path/to/file.txt
```

...but it won't do much right now unless you use the ```input.txt``` file in this repo.
